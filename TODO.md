## ToDo

- [ ] Move "Select Disenchanter" from Settings to Overview tab (2nd column).
- [ ] Restrict disenchanter selection to raid leader, party leader, and dev ("sudo dev"); hide or lock it for regular players.
- [ ] Add a mini tracker toggleable via a settings button: independent, draggable, compact roster showing only present members with class-colored names and live points; semi-transparent; auto-minimize in combat; hide when not in party/raid; expand vertically with group size; include a close/minimize button that mirrors the main UI behavior; add a slash command (ex: `/goals mini`) to toggle it; shift-clicking the minimap button toggles it too (if possible).
