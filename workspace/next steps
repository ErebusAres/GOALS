Next steps for TBC Phase 3 (T6) Wowhead builds

Context for a new chat (what Codex should know):
- Project: WoW addon data in `Goals/wishlistBuildData.lua` (build library) and `Goals/gui.lua` (icons in UI).
- We cannot browse wowhead.com/tbc directly (robots/blocked), so we use locally saved Wowhead HTML pages.
- LoonBestInSlot (TBC addon) was used as a proxy for T6 builds; those entries are labeled as LoonBiS now.
- LoonBiS source token is `loonbis` (lowercase) in `source =` and `sources =` fields.
- Loon icon is wired in UI: `Goals.IconTextures.loonbis` and row.iconLoon in `Goals/gui.lua`.
  - Icon file path: `Goals/Icons/loonbestinslot_icon.tga` (keep this path unless you rename the file).
  - UI shows Loon icon if `wishlistHasLoon(build)` finds `loonbis` (or legacy `loonbestinslot`) in tags/sources.
- Wowhead icon shows if `sources` or `tags` include the string `wowhead` (case-insensitive).
- Druid T6 entries already have Wowhead enchants from local HTML files; most other gemIds remain empty.
- Existing T6 LoonBiS notes format: "Phase data 't6' sourced from LoonBiS (TBC addon). Enchants from Wowhead gem/enchants guides."
- New Wowhead builds should follow the same slot order/formatting as existing entries.
- Do NOT replace unrelated builds; add/update only the targeted T6 entries.

What to do next:
1) Download Wowhead TBC Phase 3 (T6) BiS guide page AND the matching "Gems & Enchants" guide for each class/spec.
2) Save the HTML files into `workspace/` (the *_files directories are OK but not required).
3) Tell Codex which class/specs to process.

User required steps (manual):
- You must manually download the Wowhead HTML files and place them in `workspace/`.
- Codex does NOT browse Wowhead directly; it only parses the local HTML files you provide.

How to build/update:
- Parse the Wowhead HTML to extract item IDs, gem IDs, and enchant IDs.
- Create or update the *_TBC_T6_WOWHEAD entries in `Goals/wishlistBuildData.lua` to match existing formatting.
- If Wowhead item IDs match the LoonBiS build exactly, then either:
  - remove the LoonBiS build entirely, OR
  - relabel it to Wowhead and include the Wowhead enchants/gems.
  (Either approach is fine; just be consistent and note it in sources/notes.)
- After extracting data, remove the downloaded Wowhead HTML files from `workspace/`.

Reminders:
- Keep existing builds; do not replace unrelated entries.
- Maintain the same slot order and formatting used in current entries.
- Use `sources = {"wowhead"}` or include "wowhead" so the Wowhead icon appears in the UI.
