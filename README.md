## Long Description

GOALS provides a raid-focused workflow for managing DKP-style points and loot distribution. It tracks boss kills and wipes, keeps a history of point changes and loot assignments, and syncs data to your party or raid unless you enable local-only mode.

The Overview tab shows the roster with current points, present-only filtering, sorting, and quick actions to add, subtract, reset, undo, or remove points. It also supports manual awards and "add all present"; for example, you can award +1 to all present players right after a boss kill.

The Loot tab lets you change the loot method, review loot history (with an epic-only filter), and assign found items to players with optional point resets. The Loot Options panel configures which loot types trigger resets and the minimum item quality; for example, you can reset points only for epic mounts or tokens.

The History tab records boss kills, adjustments, wipes, and loot events so you can review decisions later. The Settings tab controls history combining, minimap button visibility, auto-minimize in combat, and data management actions to clear points, players, history, or everything. The Update tab surfaces available updates with download instructions.
